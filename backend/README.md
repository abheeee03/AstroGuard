# AstroGuard Backend API

This directory contains the FastAPI server for AstroGuard object detection service, which uses YOLOv8 to detect objects in images. The model is trained to detect objects in the International Space Station (ISS) environment such as fire extinguishers, toolboxes, and oxygen tanks.

## Features

- Object detection for space station equipment using YOLOv8
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Easy integration with frontend applications
- CORS support for cross-origin requests

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Server

Run the FastAPI server with:
```bash
python api.py
```

Or alternatively:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:8000

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Root endpoint, returns a welcome message
- `POST /detect`: Upload an image for object detection
  - Accepts: Form data with a file field
  - Returns: JSON with detected objects, bounding boxes, and a base64-encoded image with drawn bounding boxes

## Swagger Documentation

After starting the server, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
http://localhost:8000/docs

## Model Training

To train the model with custom data:

1. Organize your data in the format specified in `yolo_params.yaml`
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 10 --lr0 0.001
   ```
