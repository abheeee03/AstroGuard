# AstroGuard Frontend

This is the frontend application for AstroGuard, a space equipment detection system built with Next.js, React, and Shadcn UI. The application provides a modern and intuitive interface for uploading images and detecting objects like fire extinguishers, toolboxes, and oxygen tanks in the International Space Station (ISS) environment.

## Features

- Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
- Image upload and preview functionality
- Real-time object detection using the AstroGuard backend API
- Detailed visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes
- Confidence scores for each detected object
- Dark/Light mode toggle

## Using the Application

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Upload an image using the file input or by clicking the "Select Image" button
3. Click "Detect Objects" to send the image to the backend API
4. View the detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various hosting platforms. For the simplest deployment:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
